## Design

### Design Choices

- the website ws desgine with a 90s hip-hop vibe with a gritty, urban palette: burnt orange (#FB621C),
 and moody purple (#410547).smokey backgorunds , pixel fonts, and graffiti-inspired layouts create a raw, nostalgic feel. 
- Built for edge and nostalgia—like a mixtape in website form
- Each main page features a distinct hero section (carousel, video, banner)
- Modal and carousel interactions reinforce modern, dynamic feel


### Colour Scheme
![AdobeColor-My Color Theme (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65cee7e3-7e49-419b-9ccd-049ec4f320c7)

- Rich dark backgrounds (#000, #111) for immersive vibe
- Accent colors drawn from cover art and background
- High contrast for all buttons/text over video

### Fonts
Press Start 2P with cursive as a fallback is used everywhere ( headings, body text) to reinforce Big Homie’s retro, underground mixtape vibe.
Its blocky, pixelated forms echo classic arcade type and street-art stencil lettering while remaining legible at all sizes.

### Structure

The site follows a familiar, easy-to-learn layout: a left-aligned logo in the navbar, right-aligned links that collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile, and five main pages:
- **index.html**: Home/landing, hero slider, 
- **about.html**: Community story, mission, and call to action
- **media.html**: Grid links to music, gallery, video, and blogz
- **music.html**: Track cards with player and cover art
- **gallery.html**: Image carousel, full-screen responsive
- **video.html**: Video cards, responsive YouTube embeds
- **blogz.html**: Article previews, interactive modal for full stories
- **events.html**: Event cards, modal RSVP/ticket/artist forms
- **contact.html**: Contact form, Google Map, info box
